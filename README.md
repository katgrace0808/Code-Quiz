# [Code Quiz](https://katgrace0808.github.io/Code-Quiz/)

Code Quiz is an application where a timed quiz is presented, and a user can log their high scores.

## Description

The application opens to a home page where the user is greeted with a brief description of the quiz.  The user clicks the Start button to begin.  Once the user does this, a timer appears and it starts counting down one second at a time.  The user then begins to read the questions and clicks one of the four choices presented.

The questions:

Question #1
Who invented JavaScript?
a. Tim Berners-Lee
b. Hakon Wium lie
c. Brendan Eich
d. James Gosling
Correct answer: c

Question #2
What HTML tag is used to link to the JavaScript file?
a. <script>
b. <link>
c. <function>
d. <a src=./script.js>
Correct answer: a

Question #3
Which of the following is true about JavaScript variable names?
a. Are not case sensitive.
b. Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
c. Can begin with a number.
d. Can be used for a different variable name in the same file.
Correct answer: b

Question #4
What is the correct syntax for a JavaScript function?
a. name(function) {//code to be executed}
b. function name{//code to be executed}
c. function (//code to be executed)
d. function name() {//code to be executed}
Correct answer: d

When a user selects their choice, the next question and choices are presented.  If the choice is correct, "Correct" presents on the screen, and the timer remains at its current time and continues to count down.  If the choice is incorrect, "Wrong" presents on the screen, and the timer is reduced by 10 seconds, after which is continues to count down.

High scores are kept locally and the user can enter their initials.

## Development of the application

This was a difficult assignment, and the application is not complete.  I am working out issues with the choices presenting twice for questions two through four.  I cannot get the timer to stop once the last question is answered.  I am also still working on saving off the time with the user's initials to the High Scores page.
